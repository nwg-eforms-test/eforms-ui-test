# eForms UI Technical Exercise

During your upcoming job interview, you will be required to run this project and make changes to it. You should ensure that you can successfully run the project and share your screen over Zoom.

This technical exercise assumes that you are familiar with the following technologies...
* React
* TypeScript and JavaScript ES6+
* HTML5
* Sass or CSS3 (or both)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Let's Get Started

Prior to your interview, please carry out the following tasks...

### `Clone the Project`

Clone the project on your local machine.

### `Install the Project Dependencies`

Run the `npm install` command in your terminal to install the project's dependencies.

### `Run the Project`

Run the `npm run dev` command in your terminal to launch the project.
If the project fails to launch automatically, then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your web browser.

The page will reload when you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

**Please note:** once you run the project, there will be a NatWest Group "Brands" API running at [http://localhost:3001/api/brands](http://localhost:3001/api/brands)


## Why is There Only a Blank Screen When Running the Project?

You are supposed to see a blank (white) web page when you run the project. We will fill in all the blanks during your interview.

## See You Soon!

We look forward to meeting you at your interview, good luck! ðŸ˜Š
